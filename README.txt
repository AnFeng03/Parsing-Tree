Additional Information:

These are the symbols that I used to represent the syntactic categories for the creation of my parse trees:

<EXPRESSION> : E
<ATOM> : A
<WORD> : W
<LETTER> : Z
<WORDT> : O
<NUMBER> : N
<DIGIT> : D
<NUMBERT> : T
<LIST> : L
<ELEMENTS> : Q
<REST> : R

NOTE: they are all capital so that they are not confused with the terminal symbols
